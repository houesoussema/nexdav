# This file contains example environment variables for the MCP CalDAV Server.
# DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE WITH YOUR ACTUAL CREDENTIALS TO A PUBLIC REPOSITORY.
# Instead, create a copy named `.env` in the same directory and fill in your details there.

# Define CalDAV accounts as a JSON string.
# Each object in the list should have "url", "username", and "password".
# Example for two accounts:
# CALDAV_ACCOUNTS='[
#   {"url": "https://your-nextcloud-instance.com/remote.php/dav/calendars/YOUR_USERNAME/", "username": "your_nextcloud_username", "password": "your_nextcloud_app_password"},
#   {"url": "https://another-caldav-server.com/dav/principals/users/another_user/", "username": "another_user", "password": "another_password"}
# ]'
# CALDAV_ACCOUNTS='[]' # Example for no accounts or to be filled in .env
CALDAV_ACCOUNTS='[{"url": "https://your-nextcloud-instance.com/remote.php/dav/calendars/YOUR_USERNAME/", "username": "your_nextcloud_username", "password": "your_nextcloud_app_password"}]'
